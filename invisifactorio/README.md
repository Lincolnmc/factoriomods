# Invisifactorio

This mod causes various objects in the game world to be invisible.

The following categories of objects can be turned on and off separately:
 * Trains
 * Biters
 * Items on the ground

This mod should mostly work well with objects created by other mods. If you find
another mod which this is not compatible with, let me know and I can look into it.
