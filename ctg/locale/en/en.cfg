[mod-setting-description]
ctg-brightmap= Use brighter colors for terrain on map
ctg-initial-landfill= If enabled, start the game with a steel chest filled with landfill.
ctg-water-enable= If disabled, the map will be generated with no water and the remaining water settings will have no effect.
ctg-water-color= Water can be blue or green
ctg-water-pattern-preset= Choose which water generation pattern you would like to use. See the example screenshots for an idea of what each of the suggested options generates. Or, use "custom" to program your own water generation pattern below.
ctg-water-pattern-custom= If you chose "custom" above, this setting should be a lua expression that specifies the desired water pattern. See the README and examples for details. If your expression is very long, you can use variables called "v1" through "v4" whose values you specify below.
ctg-water-pattern-custom-v1= A lua expression whose value will be saved in the variable "v1". You can use "v2", "v3", and "v4" here. Leave it as "nil" if you do not need it.
ctg-water-pattern-custom-v2= A lua expression whose value will be saved in the variable "v2". You can use "v3" and "v4" here. Leave it as "nil" if you do not need it.
ctg-water-pattern-custom-v3= A lua expression whose value will be saved in the variable "v3". You can use "v4" here. Leave it as "nil" if you do not need it.
ctg-water-pattern-custom-v4= A lua expression whose value will be saved in the variable "v4". Leave it as "nil" if you do not need it.
ctg-void-enable= If disabled, the map will be generated with no voids (i.e., black squares) and the remaining void settings will have no effect.

ctg-force-initial-water= Creates a puddle next to the origin
ctg-big-scan= Testing: Scan a large area at the beginning of the game
ctg-screenshot= Testing: Take a screenshot of the map (use included python script)
ctg-screenshot-zoom= Testing: Take a zoomed screenshot of the map (use included python script). Can be slow!
